## Why Survival Analysis?

# You may be fooling yourself about reliability

Industries are at different levels of maturity in using quantitative approaches to reliability engineering.

```{r, message=FALSE}

## You need to fix the RDays values, they don't seem right
load("static_life_data.RData")
library(survival)
stat1.fit <- survfit(Surv(time=RDays, event=Failed) ~ 1, static_life_data.df)

plot(stat1.fit, main="Survival Curve", xlab="Run Days", ylab="Proportion Surviving")

```
