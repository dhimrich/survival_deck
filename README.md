## README.md
This is the github repo for the Reproducible Pitch Presentation portion of the Developing Data Products class within the Coursera Data Science Specialization.

The slides are published via GitHubs gh-pages service [here](http://dhimrich.github.io/survival_deck)

The Shiny App itself, which does basic survival calculations on a small data set of hardwware systems, is published via the ShinyApp.io service [here](dhimrich.shinyapps.io/CourseraSurvival)

Have a look at both products and let me know what you think, right here via GitHub. Thank you for your attention.
